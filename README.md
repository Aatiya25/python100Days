- Writing python code for 100 Days
I have worked on various projects in Core Java but ever since I started my job the learning was limited to business needs. And further due to the pandemic and my academic commitments I could not purse the learning. I am here again, enhancing my programming skills from Beginners to Advance Level in Python. I will be posting my everyday achievement and insight gained from the exercises. I am picking random programs from various websites that interestes my level of learning. 
The basic idea is to write 100 programs and and update the learning gained from each program. Hoping to complete 100 programs soon!

Day1: Rolling a dice to obtain valid input from 1-6 from user and throwing an error message if any invalid entry.

Day2: A fun program to create superman logo using python. This program best illustrates how to use maths equation in python using numpy and using matplot library to plot the equations. The plot quation for superman is obtained from the [link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zrrqxigkgk)

Similarly Try out [Batman](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dnzfajfpym) plot using the same logic!!
